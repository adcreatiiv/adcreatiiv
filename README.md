👋 Hey there, @AdCreatiiv here!

👀 I'm all about crafting psychology-driven performance ad creatives for DTC Ecom Brands. 🚀

🌱 Currently diving into the world of machine learning on GitHub, especially NLP for analyzing customer reviews on products. Gotta stay ahead in the Ecom game! 🤖🔍

💞️ Open to collaborating on anything ML-related for Ecom, maybe even automating some Python workflows and exploring the wonders of cloud computing together. 🤝💻

📫 Reach out to me through DMs here, or drop me an email at info@adcreatiiv.com. Let's cook up some AI magic! 🧠✨

😄 Pronouns: Creative Genius 🎨🤓

⚡ Fun fact: Most ecom ads are 🐶💩 but still make the bag 💰
